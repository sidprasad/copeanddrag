Each constraint consists of a type and associated parameters . Cyclic Constraints Cyclic constraints arrange related elements in a circular layout. To be more precise, related elements are laid out roughly as a regular shape of n sides, where there are n related elements in the selector. The layout below is used in the Ring Lights example to arrange a ring of lights along the boundary of a pentagon. 1 2 3 4 5 6 constraints : - cyclic : selector : left direction : clockwise directives : - flag : hideDisconnectedBuiltIns Parameters selector : A Forge expression that determines which elements upon which the constraint acts. This expression must return a set of elements of arity >= 2, and the first and last of each tuple will be used. If multiple closed relations are returned, multiple cycles are generated. For example, a selector evaluating to {(A, B), (B, C), (C,D), (E,F), (F,E)} will construct two independent shapes -- one relating A, B, C and another relating E,F . direction : [Optional] Direction in which elements will be laid out. One of clockwise or counterclockwise . Defaults to clockwise Orientation Constraints Specify the relative positioning of elements in a graph. The layout below is used in the binary tree example shows how to ensure that a node's right children are laid out below it and to its right, and that its left children are laid out below it and to its left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 constraints : - orientation : selector : right directions : - right - below - orientation : selector : left directions : - left - below directives : - attribute : field : key - flag : hideDisconnectedBuiltIns Parameters selector : A Forge expression that determines which elements upon which the constraint acts.

List of directions, which can be left , right , above , below , directlyAbove , directlyBelow , directlyLeft , directlyRight . Grouping Constraints Group elements together based on either a selector OR a field . Groups cannot intersect unless one is subsumed by another. Grouping by Field Grouping by field removes multiple edges between the group source(s) and target(s), and replaces them with the lowest number of arrows between group and element. The layout below shows the pertinent part of the Fruit in Baskets example, which uses the 0th element of the fruit relation as a key and adds elements in the 1st part of the relation to the associated group. 1 2 3 4 - group : field : fruit groupOn : 0 addToGroup : 1 Parameters field : Name of the field in the source specification upon which the constraint acts. groupOn : The 0 indexed element of the field that is used to group elements. addToGroup : The 0 indexed element of the field which should be added to the group. Grouping by Selector Grouping by selector affords a more flexible way to create groups. This operation, however, does not have required context to collapse multiple graph edges. As a result, it does not remove any edges from the graph . The layout below shows the pertinent part of the Fruit in Baskets example, which uses a n-ary selector to group rotten fruit that are in the same basket together. 1 2 3 - group : selector : '{b : Basket, a : Fruit | (a in b.fruit) and a.status = Rotten }' name : rottenFruit Parameters selector : A Forge expression that determines which elements upon which the constraint acts. If the selector evaluates to a set of singletons, all singletons are added to the group. If the selector evaluates to a set of tuples, the first element of the tuple is used as as a key upon which to group, while the last element of the tuple is added to the group associated with that key. For example, name : Name of the group to be displayed. When Constraints Cannot Be Satisfied All CnD constraints are hard constraints , and thus must be satisfied for a diagram to be produced. Constraints might not be satisfied for one of two reasons: A single CnD constraint definition could be inherently unsatisfiable. For example, a constraint on the next field that requires the same field to be laid out both leftwards and rightwards: 1 2 3 - orientation : selector : next directions : [ right , left ] This represents a bug in the CnD spec, and can be identified statically. In this case, CnD produces an error message in terms of the constraints that could not be satisfied. Some constraints may be individually satisfiable, but become contradictory when laying out a specific instance. This is akin to a dynamic error, as it depends on the structure of the instance being visualized. In both these cases, CnD does not produce a diagram . Instead, it provides an error message explaining that the constraints could not be met.","title":"Constraints"},{"location":"constraints/#constraints","text":"Constraints define spatial relationships between elements in the diagram.
