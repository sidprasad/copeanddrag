Cope and Drag (or `CnD`) is a constraint-based language 
designed to help users quickly build, modify, and explore
diagrams based on Alloy and Forge instances.
The language is based on a small number of orthogonal primitives,
and is grounded in the cognitive science literature on 
effective diagramming.




## TODO:

CnD should have a 3rd section for (~ arrangement ~)
1. Projection
2. Permutation along fields (e.g. Node->Node->Weight to Node->Weight->Node)
3. Hiding Flags (hide disconnected built ins, hide disconnected)

OR should these stay within directives.

## TODO:
Diagram compactness has been broken somewhere :(

## TODO

Change HOW we compute tuples for groupOn
