# Lightweight Visualizations for Lightweight Formal Methods

Cope and Drag (or `CnD`) is a constraint-based language 
designed to help users quickly build, modify, and explore
diagrams based on Alloy and Forge instances.
The language is based on a small number of orthogonal primitives,
and is grounded in the cognitive science literature on 
effective diagramming.

# INstalling CnD

CnD takes the form of an Express web server. You can download `CnD` from [Releases](https://github.com/sidprasad/copeanddrag/releases) and run it by `node index.js`. This will make the `CnD` server available on `localhost:3000`.
