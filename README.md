Cope and Drag (or `CnD`) is a constraint-based language 
designed to help users quickly build, modify, and explore
diagrams based on Alloy and Forge instances.

The language is based on a small number of orthogonal primitives,
and is grounded in the cognitive science literature on 
effective diagramming.

CnD is available as an npm package. You can install and launch CnD with:

```sh
npm install -g cope-and-drag
copeanddrag
```
